### Notes for James

This workspace and simple sample files will be a good
place to work on JavaScript gaming.

#### Live development hosting

When the Coud9 workspace is open, you can use the "Run"
button to make the files available to anyone at the URL
below.

https://jcal-jgquinn.c9users.io

#### Public static file hosting

The project is also connected to Github, which can
host your files for the public, even when the Cloud9
workspace is not open. Github doesn't automatically
follow your changes, though. When you're ready to publish
changes, use a command like the one below.

`git add -A; git commit -m 'brief message here'; git push`

Once your changes are pushed to Github, they are available
at the URL below, even when you are not using Cloud9.
(We may want to change this to your own account, but
this will work for now.)
